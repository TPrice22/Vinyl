Promotes music created by Vinyl

My project is a website promoting the music and services of Vinyl, an amateur music production artist. It has been tested on Chrome and Firefox (I do not have access to Safari).

CSS Features include:
1) an expanding/collapsing navigation menu with a hamburger icon for index.html
2) animation of the hamburger toggle
3) and the use of Flexbox to rearrange content areas based on mobile or desktop views on music.html and services.html.

JavaScript Features include:
1) On the Services page, the Cost Estimate form provides a list of services; as the user checks the services, it tallies a price estimate that it displays. This uses a JavaScript function to get a sum of the service values and return them to the screen for the user to view.
