# Vinyl
Promotes music created by Vinyl

My project is a website promoting the music and services of Vinyl, an amateur music production artist. CSS Features include an expanding/collapsing naviagation menu with a hamburger icon and the use of Flexbox to rearrange content areas based on mobile or desktop views. The site includes a Contact form that validates the email address format.
